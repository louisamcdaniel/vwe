Alot of iOS users have this problem. Try disabling adventure sync, force close pogo, the tenable it. Now close pogo and go for a short walk or do something for 15 min. Open pogo now to see if it is registered. Note sometime it take awhile to sync. You can also try removing pogo permission from iOS helth app and renabling it. Android Spoofer. Adventure Sync isn't required to get the weekly rewards. You are better off just disabling it and setting a GPX route. Can get all 50km needed for the week in roughly 5 hours. Adventure Sync only pays off if you actively walk/run with your device which I would assume you don't since you are trying to find a way to cheat it lol. 1. What the app does is it allows user to select a exercise duration (between 2 and minutes) and it records it as steps. Adventure Sync will then record them to distance. What i have found is that setting the timer within the range of min seems to works best. 2. level 1.
