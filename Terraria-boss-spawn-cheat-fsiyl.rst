 · Terraria. How do I summon bosses in terraria through commands. I'd recomend fighting the eye of cthullu instead of the king slime if you dont have enough gold. you just need a decent bow with lots of arrows or tons of shurikens. Just wait for the slime rain invasion and you'll fight the slime king. Some bosses have linked strategy guides in order to help players prepare for the fight. For more detailed info on bosses, see the main Bosses of Terraria Guide. Most summoning items need to be used at night, which starts at PM. Day begins at AM, when many bosses will despawn. The few exceptions are noted below. The Eye of Cthulhu. The first and probably the easiest Terraria boss you’ll encounter when you first enter a world is The Eye Of Cthulhu. This boss is a huge floating eyeball that floats in the arena. Spawn system. Once you’ve reached HP, the probability of the eye of Cthulhu to spawn at night is 33%.
