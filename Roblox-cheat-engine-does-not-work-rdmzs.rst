It's not fucking use an exploit, im sorry to tell you this but im pretty sure it's like % patched now, since roblox had this massive whatever update that brought all the exploits down for a couple of days. 2.  · Cheat Engine is 11 so I could replace it with "Twisted Self". Hit find and replace all. Open Find and replace again. Leave the fields the same, but change to Unicode. Hit find and replace all. Save Exe renamed. You now have a personalized CE .  · I do not know what to do, I'm using CheatEngine or what ever the latest is. Example: I find the code, change it from to freeze it. Nothing changes, the value is still The value shows up in many different areas like, float, 4 bytes, 2 bytes but, non of them change the game money. Or, post me a method to my problem and ill try.
