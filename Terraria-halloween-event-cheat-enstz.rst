 · Terraria: How To Summon & Defeat The Pumpkin Moon (Halloween Event)In this Terraria How to Summon Pumpkin Moon event video by the blue crusader (thebluecrusa.  · You can set it for October ish for the Halloween stuff, but that really only affects getting Goodie Bag drops and pumpkins to naturally spawn. Otherwise you can buy pumpkin seeds from the Dryad and grow your own pumpkins. Pumpkin moon can be done whenever. I think its 30 pumpkins, 5 ectoplasm and 10 Hallowed Bars for a pumpkin moon medallion. The Pumpkin Moon is a Hardmode, post-Plantera, Halloween-themed event summoned with the Pumpkin Moon Medallion any time at night, ending at dawn ( AM). It can be summoned any time of year and does not require the actual Halloween season. During the event, unique and highly difficult enemies spawn at high rates and attack the player.
