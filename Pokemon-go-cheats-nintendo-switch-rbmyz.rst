 · Country. Jan 2, #1. Hi everyone. I bought a Nintendo switch bundle Pokemon Lets GO. which is from this series "XAJ1 ". and I have an 8GB storage card. I heard that these switches are hackable so here is the Link.  · In Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Pokemon Shining Pearl you can claim the mythical Mew and Jirachi by having save data from Pokemon Sword, Pokemon Shield, and Pokemon Let's Go on your Nintendo Switch. Pokemon Sword and Pokemon Shield saves grant you Jirachi while Let's Go save data will enable you to claim Mew.  · Hi Guys, I scoured around trying to find cheats for version of Let's Go, Pikachu! and could not find anything. I know everyone has probably moved on to Sw/Sh or just using pkhex with Let's Go for save editing, but I would really appreciate it if anyone made any cheats for this (and by extension, maybe Let's Go, Eevee! too).User Interaction Count: 7.
