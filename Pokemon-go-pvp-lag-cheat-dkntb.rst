Pokemon GO. Three shields in PVP. DeusMortem 1 year ago #1. Just ran into a lowlife that used three shields in PvP. I did manage to beat him anyway, but barely; his Umbreon was left against my entire team and almost took all of them out – despite me having Medicham in there. Even though I was almost certain that all of these shields counted. Honestly, if some fools want to take the risk of jail breaking their phone to galavant around the world and catch whatever Pokémon they encounter, I could care less. It doesn’t really effect me or my game. But when some Asshat cheats to win at the PVP battles, that does interfere with my gaming experience. Don’t get me wrong. There may be some incredibly little known exploit, but the majority of players calling out "cheating" are being hit with lag and bugs. There has been no proof of any exploits being done, just videos from people that think freezing up during a match means their opponent cheated.
