 · Cheat Engine The Official Site of Cheat Engine How do I can find memory region that spawns a item for you in Terraria? I would like to find that part where I can just change item id and spawn it. I have no clue how do I can find that part of memory region. Any suggestions? Back to top: Epz Newbie cheater. Reputation: 0 Joined: 01 Jul   · For now, Cheat Sheet consists of only an Item Browser. (modeled after the Gameiki menu from Terraria days) Item Browser: Press K (or whatever hotkey you've assigned) to toggle the Item Browser on and off. Click an item to grab a full stack of that item or Shift-click to move a full stack of that item immediately to your inventory. Start a local TShock server on your machine, then join it as a client and use commands to spawn the item you want. The command you'll have to use is /item [item] [quantity], where [item] is the name of the item (in quotes if the name contains spaces). If the quantity is not specified, it defaults to the max stack size for the given item. ShareReviews: 4.
